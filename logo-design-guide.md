# WiFU Logo Design Guide

## Anime Girl Pentesting Logo Concept

For the WiFU logo, we need an anime-style female character who is ethically hacking (pentesting), similar in concept to the pwnagotchi logo but with anime styling and a more sophisticated look.

### Design Elements

1. **Character**:
   - Cute anime-style female character
   - Hacker aesthetic (optional hoodie or tech-themed outfit)
   - Could have distinctive features like colored hair or tech accessories
   - Friendly, approachable expression with a hint of mischief

2. **Tech Elements**:
   - Laptop with visible terminal or code
   - WiFi signals or network visualization
   - Possibly some cybersecurity icons (lock, shield, etc.)
   - Could include small references to WPA2/WPA3 attacks

3. **Style**:
   - Clean, modern anime style
   - Transparent background (PNG format)
   - Color scheme: Consider cybersecurity-themed colors (blues, purples, with accent colors)

4. **Format**:
   - High resolution (at least 1000x1000px)
   - PNG with transparency
   - Clean vector-like lines for scalability

### Examples to Draw Inspiration From

- The pwnagotchi face/logo for the general concept
- Anime hacker characters from cybersecurity-themed anime
- Tech-themed mascots from security tools

### Implementation Options

1. **Commission an Artist**:
   - Platforms: Fiverr, Upwork, DeviantArt, ArtStation
   - Budget range: $30-150 depending on detail level and artist experience
   - Provide this guide as a reference

2. **AI Image Generation**:
   - Tools: Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion
   - Prompt suggestion: "cute anime girl ethical hacker with laptop, cybersecurity theme, WiFi signals, transparent background, digital art style, clean lines"
   - You may need to refine multiple times to get the desired result

3. **DIY Creation**:
   - Software: Adobe Illustrator, Clip Studio Paint, or free alternatives like Inkscape or Krita
   - Start with a simple sketch and build up the character and elements

### Implementation in the Repository

Once you have the logo:

1. Save it as `wifu-logo.png` in the repository root
2. Update the README.md to reference the new logo:
   ```markdown
   <p align="center">
     <img src="wifu-logo.png" width="400" alt="WiFU Logo"/>
   </p>
   ```
3. Commit and push the changes:
   ```
   git add wifu-logo.png README.md
   git commit -m "Add custom anime girl pentesting logo"
   git push origin master
   ```

This logo will help establish a unique brand identity for WiFU that combines anime aesthetics with the ethical hacking theme.
