# WiFU Project Transformation Summary

## Completed Tasks:
1. Created the `wifu` directory structure to replace `pwnagotchi`
2. Created core files in the wifu directory:
   - `wifu/__init__.py` - Base module with updated references
   - `wifu/_version.py` - Version information with version "2.0.0"
   - `wifu/defaults.toml` - Default configuration with updated paths
   - `wifu/fs/__init__.py` - Filesystem module with updated references
   - `wifu/ui/__init__.py` - UI module
   - `wifu/ui/components.py` - UI components
   - `wifu/ui/view.py` - View component with updated references
   - `wifu/ui/state.py` - State management
   - `wifu/ui/display.py` - Display handling
   - `wifu/ui/faces.py` - UI faces configurations
   - `wifu/ui/fonts.py` - Font configurations
   - `wifu/agent.py` - Main agent functionality
   - `wifu/utils.py` - Utility functions
   - `wifu/log.py` - Logging functionality
   - `wifu/grid.py` - Grid functionality
   - `wifu/identity.py` - Identity management
   - `wifu/plugins/__init__.py` - Plugin system
   - `wifu/automata.py` - AI state machine
   - `wifu/bettercap.py` - Bettercap integration
3. Updated `setup.py` to reference `wifu` instead of `pwnagotchi`
4. Created `bin/wifu` with references to the `wifu` module instead of `pwnagotchi`
5. Created all the attack modules in `wifu_attacks/scripts`:
   - `wpa2_handshake.py` - For capturing WPA2 handshakes
   - `pmkid_attack.py` - For PMKID extraction
   - `downgrade_attack.py` - For downgrade attacks
   - `evil_twin.py` - For evil twin attacks
   - `dragonblood.py` - For WPA3 dragonblood exploitation
6. Updated README.md to reflect the WiFU project instead of pwnagotchi
7. Created all necessary AI modules:
   - `wifu/ai/__init__.py` - AI initialization
   - `wifu/ai/epoch.py` - Epoch tracking
   - `wifu/ai/featurizer.py` - Feature extraction
   - `wifu/ai/gym.py` - Training environment
   - `wifu/ai/parameter.py` - Parameter management
   - `wifu/ai/reward.py` - Reward calculation
   - `wifu/ai/train.py` - Training system

## Verification:
1. All module imports have been updated to reference `wifu` instead of `pwnagotchi`
2. All file paths and configurations have been updated from `/etc/pwnagotchi` to `/etc/wifu`
3. The main executable (`bin/wifu`) correctly references the wifu module
4. Setup.py has been configured to package the wifu module
5. Attack scripts are properly implemented and functional

## Project Status:
- The full transformation from pwnagotchi to WiFU is complete
- All necessary files have been created with updated references
- The UI components and core functionality have been preserved
- New attack tools have been added to enhance the WiFU functionality
- Configuration has been updated to use WiFU paths and settings

The transformation is now complete, and the WiFU project is ready for use as a full-featured WiFi attack toolkit with the original pwnagotchi functionality preserved and enhanced with direct attack capabilities.
